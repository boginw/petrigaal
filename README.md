_Petri Game Strategy Synthesis_

**NB**: This is still a work in progress. Breaking changes can be expected.

## Getting Started

To get started make sure that you have Java 16 or higher installed. The program requires two things, a model and a formula. Models are either PNMLs or TAPNs. We recommend creating your models using [TAPAAL](http://www.tapaal.net/) when creating models with multiple players. 

### Note on Syntax

For now, the syntax requires a space between the quantifier and the operator, so `AF(P1 = 1)` has to be written `A F(P1 = 1)`.
